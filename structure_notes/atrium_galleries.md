Sort of the splash page for the museum

- Will have basic static illusions in picture frames
- Maybe add a short desc. tile to the right of each piece.

Modeled after this place https://exarteblog.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/griffin_court-optimized.jpg

Textures:
- Light wood floor
- Detailed ceiling window
- Silver reflective detail
- General white paint material

Will need LOTS of really good light work.
