# Impossible-Worlds
VR Demo for mystery and optical illusions.

Roadmap:

- [ ] Proof-of-concept work
  - [ ] Test teleporting in unity
  - [ ] Map element decomposition for movement (do penrose steps move when you’re not looking at them? if so, they can’t be static like the rest of the map)
  - [ ] Test Blender -> Unity pipeline again (scaling, navigability with VR)
- [ ] Survey any real-life settings
  - [ ] Collect photos/list of desired textures
  - [ ] Decide on measurements (how high stairs are, ceiling heights, etc)
  - [ ] Compile rough list of what entities (small, high-poly map detail items) are needed
- [ ] Create final floorplans
  - [ ] My apt bldg
  - [ ] Atrium/static gallery, video gallery (modeled after AIC)
  - [ ] Room of other worlds, including text projection centerpiece
  - [ ] Escher’s Waterfall
  - [ ] Penrose Steps
  - [ ] Nate’s Creations (caves, dark water)
- [ ] Design look of structures
- [ ] Model/Texture structures
- [ ] Model/Texture entities
  - [ ] Import/make little map things (plants, mailboxes, papers, coffee mugs, etc)
  - [ ] Make optical illusion structures
  - [ ] Add textures to structures for optical illusions gallery
- [ ] Add Lights
- [ ] Add interactivity
  - [ ] Doors opening
  - [ ] People on penrose steps?
  - [ ] Maybe some wind or other atmospherics
- [ ] Add sounds
